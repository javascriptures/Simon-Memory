Welcome to the Simon Memory Game! Designed after the classic, handheld game Simon, this game tests your ability to replicate a pattern of colors in the correct order.

To play this game, first open https://javascriptures.github.io/Simon-Memory/ in your browser. Your screen should display the image above. To begin the game, press the "START" button. A random color button will light up, prompting the user (you) to repeat this single sequence back. Once the sequence is repeated, another sequence will light up, building on the previous. The game will keep track of your score as you progress through the game. For demonstration purposes, the score caps off at 5 points, at which point you will be treated with a little winner's surprise!

Now for the nerd stuff...
